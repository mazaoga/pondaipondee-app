# 🚀 Quick Deployment Guide

## Current Status
✅ Project built successfully  
✅ Git repository initialized  
✅ GitHub Actions workflow fixed  
✅ Google Sheets API configured  

## Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Push to GitHub Repository
Since you already have the repository `mazaoga/pondaipondee-app`, push the current code:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/mazaoga/pondaipondee-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
Go to your repository settings and configure GitHub Pages:

1. Go to `https://github.com/mazaoga/pondaipondee-app/settings/pages`
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Save the settings

### 3. Update Repository Permissions
The deployment error happens because GitHub Actions needs proper permissions:

1. Go to `https://github.com/mazaoga/pondaipondee-app/settings/actions`
2. Under "General" → "Workflow permissions"
3. Select **"Read and write permissions"**
4. Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
5. Save

### 4. Manual Deploy Alternative
If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build and push to the `gh-pages` branch directly.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If GitHub Actions still fails:
1. Check repository is **public** (private repos need GitHub Pro for Pages)
2. Verify workflow permissions are set correctly
3. Make sure you have admin access to the repository

### If site doesn't load correctly:
1. Check the base path in `vite.config.ts` matches your repository name
2. Verify all assets are loading (check browser console)

## 🌐 Live URL
After successful deployment, your app will be available at:
**https://mazaoga.github.io/pondaipondee-app**
